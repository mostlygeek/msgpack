About
-----

Forked and Patched from the original msgpack C sharp libaries so the ObjectPacker 
supports more features: 

* able to encode/decode enums correctly
* able to encode/decode Dictionary<string, Y> correctly (could change)
** this is more inline with a JSON object
** the value Y can be any type that msgpack can encode

Motivation
==========

1. A fast working C# binary serializer that works in Unity3D
1. Able to encode dynamic Dictionary<string, Y> types correctly
